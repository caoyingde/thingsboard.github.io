### ERROR: You must define a "concept" variable

{: style="color:red" }

This template requires a variable called `concept` that is simply the name of the concept for which you are giving an overview. This will be displayed in the headings for the document.

To get rid of this message and take advantage of this template, define `concept`:

```text
{% raw %}{% assign concept="Replication Controller" %}{% endraw %}
```

Complete this task, then we'll walk you through preparing the rest of the document.
