[Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) is a credit-card sized computer. It is able to run Linux and has WiFi module built-in \(starting Raspberry Pi 3\).

The applications in these samples that are running on [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) are written in Python programming language. However, you are able to use other programming languages and OS.

## Samples

* [Raspberry Pi GPIO control over MQTT using ThingsBoard](https://github.com/caoyingde/thingsboard.github.io/tree/9437083b88083a9b2563248432cbbe460867fbaf/docs/samples/raspberry/gpio/README.md)
