# message-type-filter

## Overview

This component allows filtering incoming messages by type. This filter is very efficient. We recommend using this filter in almost every rule to quickly ignore irrelevant messages.

## Configuration

You are able to select multiple types: "Get Attributes", "Post Attributes", "Post Telemetry" and "RPC Request".

## Example

As a system administrator, you are able to review filter example inside **Rules-&gt;System Telemetry Rule-&gt;Filters-&gt;Message Telemetry Filter**.
