This guide will help you to get familiar with OPC-UA extension configuration for ThingsBoard IoT Gateway. Use [general configuration](https://github.com/caoyingde/thingsboard.github.io/tree/9437083b88083a9b2563248432cbbe460867fbaf/docs/iot-gateway/configuration/README.md) to enable this extension. We will describe extension configuration file below.

### Extension configuration: opc-config.json

Extension configuration is a JSON file that contains information about how to connect and monitor a list of OPC-UA servers. The root JSON element should contain "servers" array. Each server in the array is configured using following properties:

#### Basic connection properties

| **Property** | **Description** | **Default Value** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| applicationName | Name of the client application, used for OPC-UA connection. | ThingsBoard OPC-UA client |
| applicationUri | URI of the client application, used for OPC-UA connection. |  |
| host | OPC-UA server host | localhost |
| port | OPC-UA server port | 49320 |
| scanPeriodInSeconds | Interval for complete OPC-UA server structure re-scan. Used to detect new or deleted devices. | 10 |
| timeoutInMillis | OPC-UA server connection timeout in milliseconds. | 5000 |
| security | OPC-UA security option. See [SecurityPolicy](https://github.com/eclipse/milo/blob/master/opc-ua-stack/stack-core/src/main/java/org/eclipse/milo/opcua/stack/core/security/SecurityPolicy.java) for more details. | Basic128Rsa15 |

For Example:

```javascript
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "applicationName": "ThingsBoard OPC-UA client",
      "applicationUri": "urn:thingsboard:client",
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": 49320,
      "scanPeriodInSeconds": 10,
      "timeoutInMillis": 5000,
      "security": "Basic128Rsa15"
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Client identity properties

OPC-UA extension supports "anonymous" and "username" client identities. Example of anonymous identity configuration:

```javascript
{
      ...
      "identity": {
        "type": "anonymous"
      }
      ...
}
```

Example of username identity configuration:

```javascript
{
      ...
      "identity": {
        "type": "username",
        "username": "Your username",
        "password": "Your password"
      }
      ...
}
```

#### Keystore configuration

Keystore information is used to setup encrypted connection between Gateway OPC-UA client and your OPC-UA server. Many OPC-UA servers require provisioning of client key on the server before client can connect. Supported keystore types are JKS and PKCS12. Example of keystore configuration:

```javascript
{
      ...
      "keystore": {
        "type": "PKCS12",
        "location": "your-certs.pfx",
        "password": "your-keystore-password",
        "alias": "your-client-key",
        "keyPassword": "your-client-password"
      }
      ...
}
```

#### Mapping

Mapping configuration setup rules of OPC-UA server monitoring and data conversion to ThingsBoard Key-Value format. For example:

```javascript
{
...
  "mapping": [
    {
      "deviceNodePattern": "Channel1\\.Device\\d+$",
      "deviceNamePattern": "Device ${_System._DeviceId}",
      "attributes": [
        {"key":"Tag1", "type": "string", "value": "${Tag1}"}
      ],
      "timeseries": [
        {"key":"Tag2", "type": "long", "value": "${Tag2}"}
      ]
    }
    ...
  ]
}
```

Mapping process periodically traverse the OPC-UA server node tree and applies the regular expression that is configured in **deviceNodePattern** parameter for each mapping configuration. The ist of nodes that match the regular expression is stored as device nodes. Now mapping process will use **deviceNamePattern** to get device name value. You can use OPC-UA tags inside the pattern by specifying their relative \(to device node\) names. See example below. Similar mapping rules are applied for **attributes** and **timeseries** values:

* **key** - constant Attribute or Timeseries ThingsBoard key.
* **type** - either boolean, long, double or string.
* **value** - expression based on relative tag values specified inside **${}**
