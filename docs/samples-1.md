## Demo Account

ThingsBoard installation contains [**single tenant account**](https://github.com/caoyingde/thingsboard.github.io/tree/9437083b88083a9b2563248432cbbe460867fbaf/docs/samples/demo-account/README.md) that is used in sample applications and contains a lot of pre-provisioned entities for demonstration purposes.

## Hardware platforms

The ThingsBoard samples are grouped by hardware platform.

**Note** ThingsBoard provides hardware independent APIs. If your device platform is not in the list, but is able to setup HTTP, CoAP or MQTT connections - it is possible to integrate it with ThingsBoard. ThingsBoard team is working on samples applications for Intel Edison, C.H.I.P, Tessel, Samsung Artik and Gemalto and will upload them to this page as soon as possible.
