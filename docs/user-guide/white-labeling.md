ThingsBoard web interface allows you to configure your company or product logo and color scheme in 2 minutes with zero coding efforts and no service restart required. The following configuration options are available:

* Configure color scheme, icon and favicon on System Administrator level.
* Tenant and Customer Administrator UI inherits configuration changes by default.
* Tenant and Customer Administrators are able to setup their own white-labeling configuration.
* System and Tenant Administrator are able to setup custom email server settings and customer email templates to interact with the users.

Coming soon features:

* Allow System administrator to enable/disable white-labeling for each tenant
* Allow Tenant administrator to enable/disable white-labeling for each customer
